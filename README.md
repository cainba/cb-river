## cb-river a river based desktop environment

cb-river is an experimental, River-based desktop environment built largely from scratch.

It uses the River Wayland compositor as the foundation, with Bun driving the main processes and C handling low-level Wayland and wlroots protocols. Notifications, menus, panels, and other desktop components will be implemented here.

- [] WLRoots and Wayland Bindings using bun:ffi
- [] Process state
- [] Launcher Menu
- [] Modals

Until I make things feature complete, I will not be concerned with iterative development as this is just a hobby project. Once I feel a good 1.0 exists then feat/patch branches will exist.
